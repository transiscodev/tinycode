<p style="text-align: center">This coronavirus (COVID-19) health crisis continues to change rapidly, and today was no exception. As such, we want to provide you all with the latest information we have and share how we are responding in our school district, including one elementary school closure tomorrow, March 13, and the closure of all schools on Monday, March 16.

First, we want to share with everyone that we have reason to believe that an individual who has connections to Pioneer Elementary School has tested presumptive positive for COVID-19. While the results of the test have not been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), out of an abundance of caution we are closing Pioneer Elementary School tomorrow, Friday, March 13.<h4>Patrick Murphy, Superintendent of The Olympia School District</h4></p>
